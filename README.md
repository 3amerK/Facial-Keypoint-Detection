# Facial-Keypoint-Detection

Computer Vision Nanodegree Program

Project 1: Facial Keypoint Detection

This project combine knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures 
to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts
the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!

The model contain a self made CNN using pythorch.
